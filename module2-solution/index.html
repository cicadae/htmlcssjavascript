        <p>The role of a tank in the group is to take damage for the group, protecting the others from being attacked. Tanks usually have high health, high armor, and often high Avoidance. Their job is to keep the monster's Threat or attention on them, preventing the monster from attacking others in the group, who are often less armored and less able to take the damage from the monsters (mobs). Tanks are often the leaders of the group, the first ones into a fight and the last ones out. Good tanks can make a very hard dungeon seem easy.</p>

        <section id="dps">DPS</section>
        <p>The role of DPS is to kill the monsters. This may sound simplistic, but it takes skill and know-how to dish out powerful damage without overwhelming the group's tank and causing the monsters to attack you.</p>

      <div class="col-lg-4 col-md-12">
        <section id="heals">Heals</section>
        <p>The role of a healer in the group is to heal others when they are hurt or take damage, thus keeping party members alive in order to tank or kill the enemies. The role often requires quick reaction time and steady nerves. The healer is often credited (wrongly or correctly) with good groups and bad.</p>
